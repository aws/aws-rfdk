## Steps to Build and Publish a Lamda Layer

1. Run `yarn` and `yarn run build` to transpile the scripts written in TypeScript
1. Run `bash ./build-layer.sh <layer_name>` from the bin directory. The layer name should match the layer's directory
name, found in the `layers` directory.
1. Setup your AWS account's credentials. Make sure you are using the account you want to publish the layer into.
1. Run `node ./publish.js <layer_name>` using the same layer name that you just built.
1. Repeat the build and publish steps for any additional layers you need published.
1. Run `node ./write-ts.js <layer_name> ...` where you use all the layer names as separate
parameters. The output of this command is a file that is put in packages/aws-rfdk/lib/lambdas that contains JSON with
all the Layers' regional ARNs.
