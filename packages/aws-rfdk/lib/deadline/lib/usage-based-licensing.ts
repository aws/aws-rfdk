 * This construct is an implementation of the Deadline component that is required for Usage-based Licensing (UBL)
 * (see: https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/licensing-usage-based.html )
 * in a render farm.
 *
 * Internally this is implemented as one or more instances of the Deadline License Forwarder application set up
 * to communicate to the render queue and Thinkbox’s licensing system, and to allow ingress connections
 * from the worker nodes so that they can acquire licenses as needed.
 *
 * The Deadline License Forwarder is set up to run within an AWS ECS task.
 *
 * Access to the running License Forwarder is gated by a security group that, by default, allows no ingress;
 * when a Deadline Worker requires access to licensing, then the RFDK constructs will grant that worker’s security group
 * ingress on TCP port 17004 as well as other ports as required by the specific licenses being used.
 *
 * Note: This construct does not currently implement the Deadline License Forwarder's Web Forwarding functionality.
 * This construct is not usable in any China region.
 *
 * Resources Deployed
 * ------------------------
 * - The Auto Scaling Group (ASG) added to the Amazon Elastic Container Service cluster that is hosting the Deadline
 *   License Forwarder for UBL. This creates one C5 Large instance by default.
 * - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) device(s) associated with the EC2 instance(s) in the ASG. The default volume size is 30 GiB.
 * - An Amazon CloudWatch log group that contains the logs from the Deadline License Forwarder application.
 *
 * Security Considerations
 * ------------------------
 * - The instances deployed by this construct download and run scripts from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance
 *   is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions
 *   performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK
 *   bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
 *   environments.
 * - The Deadline License Forwarder is designed to be secured by restricting network access to it. For security, only the Deadline
 *   Workers that require access to Usage-based Licenses should be granted network access to the instances deployed by this construct.
 *   Futhermore, you should restrict that access to only the product(s) that those workers require when deploying this construct.
