 *
 * When the worker fleet is deployed if it has been provided a HealthMonitor the Worker fleet will register itself against the Monitor
 * to ensure that the fleet remains healthy.
 *
 * Resources Deployed
 * ------------------------
 * - An EC2 Auto Scaling Group to maintain the number of instances.
 * - An Instance Role and corresponding IAM Policy.
 * - An Amazon CloudWatch log group that contains the Deadline Worker, Deadline Launcher, and instance-startup logs for the instances
 *   in the fleet.
 *
 * Security Considerations
 * ------------------------
 * - The instances deployed by this construct download and run scripts from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance
 *   is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions
 *   performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK
 *   bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
 *   environments.
 * - The data that is stored on your Worker's local EBS volume can include temporary working files from the applications
 *   that are rendering your jobs and tasks. That data can be sensitive or privileged, so we recommend that you encrypt
 *   the data volumes of these instances using either the provided option or by using an encrypted AMI as your source.
 * - The software on the AMI that is being used by this construct may pose a security risk. We recommend that you adopt a
 *   patching strategy to keep this software current with the latest security patches. Please see
 *   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rfdk/latest/guide/patching-software.html for more information.
