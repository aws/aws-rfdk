 * ------------------------
 * - The instances configured by this construct will download and run scripts from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance
 *   is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions
 *   performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK
 *   bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
