/**
 * This construct is responsible for the deep health checks of compute instances.
 * It also replaces unhealthy instances and suspends unhealthy fleets.
 * Although, using this constructs adds up additional costs for monitoring,
 * it is highly recommended using this construct to help avoid / minimize runaway costs for compute instances.
 *
 * An instance is considered to be unhealthy when:
 *   1) Deadline client is not installed on it;
 *   2) Deadline client is installed but not running on it;
 *   3) RCS is not configured correctly for Deadline client;
 *   4) it is unable to connect to RCS due to any infrastructure issues;
 *   5) the health monitor is unable to reach it because of some infrastructure issues.
 *
 * A fleet is considered to be unhealthy when:
 *   1) at least 1 instance is unhealthy for the configured grace period;
 *   2) a percentage of unhealthy instances in the fleet is above a threshold at any given point of time.
 *
 * This internally creates an array of application load balancers and attaches
 * the worker-fleet (which internally is implemented as an Auto Scaling Group) to its listeners.
 * There is no load-balancing traffic on the load balancers,
 * it is only used for health checks.
 * Intention is to use the default properties of laod balancer health
 * checks which does HTTP pings at frequent intervals to all the
 * instances in the fleet and determines its health. If any of the
 * instance is found unhealthy, it is replaced. The target group
 * also publishes the unhealthy target count metric which is used
 * to identify the unhealthy fleet.
 *
 * Other than the default instance level protection, it also creates a lambda
 * which is responsible to set the fleet size to 0 in the event of a fleet
 * being sufficiently unhealthy to warrant termination.
 * This lambda is triggered by CloudWatch alarms via SNS (Simple Notification Service).
 *
 * Resources Deployed
 * ------------------------
 * - Application Load Balancer(s) doing frequent pings to the workers.
 * - An Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic for all unhealthy fleet notifications.
 * - An AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Key to encrypt SNS messages - If no encryption key is provided.
 * - An Amazon CloudWatch Alarm that triggers if a worker fleet is unhealthy for a long period.
 * - Another CloudWatch Alarm that triggers if the healthy host percentage of a worker fleet is lower than allowed.
 * - A single AWS Lambda function that sets fleet size to 0 when triggered in response to messages on the SNS Topic.
 * - Execution logs of the AWS Lambda function are published to a log group in Amazon CloudWatch.
 *
 * Security Considerations
 * ------------------------
 * - The AWS Lambda that is deployed through this construct will be created from a deployment package
 *   that is uploaded to your CDK bootstrap bucket during deployment. You must limit write access to
 *   your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions performed by this Lambda.
 *   We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK bootstrap bucket,
 *   or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
 *   environments.
 * - The AWS Lambda that is created by this construct to terminate unhealthy worker fleets has permission to
 *   UpdateAutoScalingGroup ( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_UpdateAutoScalingGroup.html )
 *   on all of the fleets that this construct is monitoring. You should not grant any additional actors/principals the
 *   ability to modify or execute this Lambda.
 * - Execution of the AWS Lambda for terminating unhealthy workers is triggered by messages to the Amazon Simple
 *   Notification Service (SNS) Topic that is created by this construct. Any principal that is able to publish notification
 *   to this SNS Topic can cause the Lambda to execute and reduce one of your worker fleets to zero instances. You should
 *   not grant any additional principals permissions to publish to this SNS Topic.
