/**
 * This construct provides a mechanism that adds 1GB-sized files containing only zero-bytes
 * to an Amazon EFS filesystem through a given Access Point to that filesystem. This is being
 * provided to give you a way to increase the baseline throughput of an Amazon EFS filesystem
 * that has been deployed in bursting throughput mode (see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#throughput-modes).
 * This is most useful for your Amazon EFS filesystems that contain a very small amount of data and
 * have a baseline throughput that exceeds the throughput provided by the size of the filesystem.
 *
 * When deployed in bursting throughput mode, an Amazon EFS filesystem provides you with a baseline
 * throughput that is proportional to the amount of data stored in that filesystem. However, usage
 * of that filesystem is allowed to burst above that throughput; doing so consumes burst credits that
 * are associated with the filesystem. When all burst credits have been expended, then your filesystem
 * is no longer allowed to burst throughput and you will be limited in throughput to the greater of 1MiB/s
 * or the throughput dictated by the amount of data stored in your filesystem; the filesystem will be able
 * to burst again if it is able to accrue burst credits by staying below its baseline throughput for a time.
 *
 * Customers that deploy the Deadline Repository Filesystem on an Amazon EFS filesystem may find that
 * the filesystem does not contain sufficient data to meet the throughput needs of Deadline; evidenced by
 * a downward trend in EFS bursting credits over time. When bursting credits are expended, then the render
 * farm may begin to exhibit failure mode behaviors such as the RenderQueue dropping or refusing connections,
 * or becoming unresponsive.
 *
 * If you find that your Amazon EFS is depleting its burst credits and would like to increase the
 * amount of padding that has been added to it then you can either:
 * - Modify the value of the desired padding property of this construct and redeploy your infrastructure
 *   to force an update; or
 * - Manually invoke the AWS Step Function that has been created by this construct by finding it
 *   in your AWS Console (its name will be prefixed with "<id of this construct>StateMachine"), and
 *   then start an execution of the state machine with the following JSON document as input:
 *   { "desiredPadding": <number of GiB you want to store> }
 *
 * Warning: The implementation of this construct creates and starts an AWS Step Function to add the files
 * to the filesystem. The execution of this Step Function occurs asynchronously from your deployment. We recommend
 * verifying that the step function completed successfully via your Step Functions console.
 *
 * Resources Deployed
 * --------------------------
 * - Two AWS Lambda Functions, with roles, with full access to the given EFS Access Point.
 * - An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) for each Lambda Function in each of the selected VPC Subnets, so
 *   that the Lambda Functions can connect to the given EFS Access Point.
 * - An AWS Step Function to coordinate execution of the two Lambda Functions.
 * - Security Groups for each AWS Lambda Function.
 * - A CloudFormation custom resource that executes StepFunctions.startExecution on the Step Function
 *   whenever the stack containing this construct is created or updated.
 *
 * Security Considerations
 * ---------------------------
 * - The AWS Lambdas that are deployed through this construct will be created from a deployment package
 *   that is uploaded to your CDK bootstrap bucket during deployment. You must limit write access to
 *   your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions performed by these Lambdas.
 *   We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK bootstrap bucket,
 *   or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
 *   environments.
 * - By default, the network interfaces created by this construct's AWS Lambda Functions have Security Groups
 *   that restrict egress access from the Lambda Function into your VPC such that the Lambda Functions can
 *   access only the given EFS Access Point.
