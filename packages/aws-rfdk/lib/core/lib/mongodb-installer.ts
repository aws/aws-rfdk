 * This class provides a mechanism to install a version of MongoDB Community Edition during the
 * initial launch of an instance. MongoDB is installed from the official sources using the system
 * package manger (yum). It installs the mongodb-org metapackage which will install the following packages:
 * 1) mongodb-org-mongos;
 * 2) mongodb-org-server;
 * 3) mongodb-org-shell; and
 * 4) mongodb-org-tools.
 *
 * Successful installation of MongoDB with this class requires:
 * 1) Explicit acceptance of the terms of the SSPL license, under which MongoDB is distributed; and
 * 2) The instance on which the installation is being performed is in a subnet that can access
 * the official MongoDB sites: https://repo.mongodb.org/ and https://www.mongodb.org
 *
 * Resources Deployed
 * ------------------------
 * - A CDK Asset package containing the installation scripts is deployed to your CDK staging bucket.
 *
 * Security Considerations
 * ------------------------
 * - Since this class installs MongoDB from official sources dynamically during instance start-up, it is succeptable
 *   to an attacker compromising the official MongoDB Inc. distribution channel for MongoDB. Such a compromise may
 *   result in the installation of unauthorized MongoDB binaries. Executing this attack would require an attacker
 *   compromise both the official installation packages and the MongoDB Inc. gpg key with which they are signed.
 * - Using this construct on an instance will result in that instance dynamically downloading and running scripts
 *   from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap
 *   bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that
 *   you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK bootstrap bucket, or enable AWS CloudTrail on your
 *   account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production environments.
