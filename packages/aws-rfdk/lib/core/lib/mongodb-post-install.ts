/**
 * This construct performs post-installation setup on a MongoDB database by logging into the database, and
 * executing commands against it. To provide this functionality, this construct will create an AWS Lambda function
 * that is granted the ability to connect to the given MongoDB using its administrator credentials. This lambda
 * is run automatically when you deploy or update the stack containing this construct. Logs for all AWS Lambdas are
 * automatically recorded in Amazon CloudWatch.
 *
 * Presently, the only post-installation action that this construct can perform is creating users. There are two types
 * of users that it can create:
 * 1. Password-authenticated users -- these users will be created within the 'admin' database.
 * 2. X.509-authenticated users -- these users will be created within the '$external' database.
 *
 * Resources Deployed
 * ------------------------
 * - An AWS Lambda that is used to connect to the MongoDB application, and perform post-installation tasks.
 * - A CloudFormation Custom Resource that triggers execution of the Lambda on stack deployment, update, and deletion.
 * - An Amazon CloudWatch log group that records history of the AWS Lambda's execution.
 *
 * Security Considerations
 * ------------------------
 * - The AWS Lambda that is deployed through this construct will be created from a deployment package
 *   that is uploaded to your CDK bootstrap bucket during deployment. You must limit write access to
 *   your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions performed by this Lambda.
 *   We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK bootstrap bucket,
 *   or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
 *   environments.
 * - The AWS Lambda function that is created by this resource has access to both the MongoDB administrator credentials,
 *   and the MongoDB application port. An attacker that can find a way to modify and execute this lambda could use it to
 *   modify or read any data in the database. You should not grant any additional actors/principals the ability to modify
 *   or execute this Lambda.
