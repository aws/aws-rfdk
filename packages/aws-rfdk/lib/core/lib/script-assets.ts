 *
 * Security Considerations
 * ------------------------
 * - Using this construct on an instance will result in that instance dynamically downloading and running scripts
 *   from your CDK bootstrap bucket when that instance is launched. You must limit write access to your CDK bootstrap
 *   bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions performed by these scripts. We strongly recommend that
