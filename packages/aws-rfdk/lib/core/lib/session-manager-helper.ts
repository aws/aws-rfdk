 * This is a helper class meant to make it easier to use the AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
 * with any EC2 Instances or AutoScalingGroups. Once enabled, the Session Manager can be used to
 * connect to an EC2 Instance through the AWS Console and open a shell session in the browser.
 *
 * Note that in order for the Session Manager to work, you will need an AMI that has the SSM-Agent
 * installed and set to run at startup. The Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon provided Windows Server AMI's
 * have this configured by default.
 *
