/**
 * This construct takes the name of a CloudWatch LogGroup and will either create it if it doesn't already exist,
 * or reuse the existing one. It also creates a regularly scheduled lambda that will export LogEvents to S3
 * before they expire in CloudWatch.
 *
 * It's used for cost-reduction, as it is more economical to archive logs in S3 than CloudWatch when
 * retaining them for more than a week.
 * Note, that it isn't economical to export logs to S3 if you plan on storing them for less than
 * 7 days total (CloudWatch and S3 combined).
 *
 * Resources Deployed
 * ------------------------
 * - The Lambda SingletonFunction that checks for the existence of the LogGroup.
 * - The CloudWatch LogGroup (if it didn't exist already).
 * - The CloudWatch Alarm watching log exportation failures.
 * - The CloudWatch Event Rule to schedule log exportation.
 * - The Lambda SingletonFunction, with role, to export log groups to S3 by schedule.
 *
 * Security Considerations
 * ------------------------
 * - The AWS Lambda that is deployed through this construct will be created from a deployment package
 *   that is uploaded to your CDK bootstrap bucket during deployment. You must limit write access to
 *   your CDK bootstrap bucket to prevent an attacker from modifying the actions performed by this Lambda.
 *   We strongly recommend that you either enable Amazon S3 server access logging on your CDK bootstrap bucket,
 *   or enable AWS CloudTrail on your account to assist in post-incident analysis of compromised production
 *   environments.
