# RFDK Sample Application - Deadline Spot Event Plugin - Python

## Overview
[Back to overview](../README.md)

## Instructions

---
**NOTE**

These instructions assume that your working directory is `examples/deadline/All-In-AWS-Infrastructure-SEP/python/` relative to the root of the AWS-RFDK package.

---

1.  This sample app on the `mainline` branch may contain features that have not yet been officially released, and may not be available in the `aws-rfdk` package installed through pip from PyPI. To work from an example of the latest release, please switch to the `release` branch. If you would like to try out unreleased features, you can stay on `mainline` and follow the instructions for building, packing, and installing the `aws-rfdk` from your local repository.
2.  Install the dependencies of the sample app:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  If working on the `release` branch, this step can be skipped. If working on `mainline`, navigate to the base directory where the build and packaging scripts are, then run them and install the result over top of the `aws-rfdk` version that was installed in the previous step:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the root directory of the RFDK repository
    pushd ../../../..
    # Enter the Docker container to run the build and pack scripts
    ./scripts/rfdk_build_environment.sh
    ./build.sh
    ./pack.sh
    # Exit the Docker container
    exit
    # Navigate back to the example directory
    popd
    pip install ../../../../dist/python/aws-rfdk-<version>.tar.gz
    ```
4.  Change the value in the `deadline_client_linux_ami_map` variable in `package/config.py` to include the region + AMI ID mapping of your EC2 AMI(s) with Deadline Worker. You can use the following AWS CLI query to find AMI ID's:
    ```bash
    aws --region <region> ec2 describe-images \
    --owners 357466774442 \
    --filters "Name=name,Values=*Worker*" "Name=name,Values=*<version>*" \
    --query 'Images[*].[ImageId, Name]' \
    --output text
    ```

    And enter it into this section of `package/config.py`:
    ```python
    # For example, in the us-west-2 region
    self.deadline_client_linux_ami_map: Mapping[str, str] = {
        'us-west-2': '<your ami id>'
    }
    ```

    ---

    **Note:** The next two steps are optional. You may skip these if you do not need SSH access into your render farm.

    ---
5.  Create an EC2 key pair to give you SSH access to the render farm:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name <key-name>
    ```
6.  Change the value of the `key_pair_name` variable in `package/config.py` to your value for `<key-name>` in the previous step:

    **Note:** Save the value of the `"KeyMaterial"` field as a file in a secure location. This is your private key that you can use to SSH into the render farm.

    ```python
    self.key_pair_name: Optional[str] = '<your key pair name>'
    ```
7. Stage the Docker recipes for `RenderQueue`:

    ```bash
    # Set this value to the version of RFDK your application targets
    RFDK_VERSION=<version_of_RFDK>

    # Set this value to the version of AWS Thinkbox Deadline you'd like to deploy to your farm. Deadline 10.1.12 and up are supported.
    RFDK_DEADLINE_VERSION=<version_of_deadline>

    npx --package=aws-rfdk@${RFDK_VERSION} stage-deadline --output stage ${RFDK_DEADLINE_VERSION}
    ```
8. Deploy all the stacks in the sample app:

    ```bash
    cdk deploy "*"
    ```

9. Once you are finished with the sample app, you can tear it down by running:

    ```bash
    cdk destroy "*"
    ```
