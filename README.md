# Render Farm Deployment Kit on AWS (RFDK)

The Render Farm Deployment Kit on AWS is an open-source library for use with the
[AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) that is designed to help you
deploy, configure, and maintain your render farm infrastructure in the cloud.

It offers high-level object-oriented abstractions to define render farm infrastructure
using the power of Python and Typescript.

The RFDK is available in:
- Javascript, Typescript ([Node.js >= 14.19.3](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/))
  - We recommend using an [Active LTS Release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
- Python ([Python >= 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

Note: Language version compatibility is the greater of those listed above and
the versions listed in the [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/README.md).
